Android Media Center Client
---------------------------

General
-------

The App is a mere client to the following project: Tiny Media Center Server, which may be found here:
https://github.com/GOMF/mcs
The main focus at the moment is to implement a usable app and later on to implement the whole
scale of functionality provided by the server and finally making it visually more appealing...

The App requires at least Android 4.1 (minSdkVersion="16").
It does work with SDK19 and should work also on Android L.

Current features:
-----------------

- Connecting to the server
- Setting the appropriate admin key
- Playback of audio files
- Playback of video files
- Listing all supported audio, video and rom files
- Controlling the playback of video and audio files
- Displaying available tag information
- Restarting the server
- Shutting down the server
- Multilingual (en, hu, de)
- Use Sliding Tabs for the playlist
- Switching between previous and next file is possible
  -> it works for all file types now, even though it makes not much sense atm for ROM files
- Handling rom files properly -> early stages - not trying to display tag infos anymore
  -> NES files should be "playable" if fceu is present
- Fixed issue with screen rotation and added ScrollViews were necessary
- Removed TitleBar were it takes up to much space in landscape mode
- App should have smaller memory footprint if in background and should close completely on Android 5 and onwards
- Input validation -> more robust
- minSDK increased to API 16 -> Jelly Bean 4.1 -> necessary for input validation
- Displaying all available tag information + support for multilingualism
- Replaced most of the hardcoded messages
- Helper Class for fragments for identically executed tasks
- Server Status is checkable through App
- ParseXML non static!
- simplified several methods within ParseXML
- Support for server compiled without taglib
- Added custom toasts for better user experience (blue == info, red == error, green == success)
- Login and SetAdminKey input fields become only bluish if input criteria are met
- Fixed offset issue for good
- Eliminated several possible NullPointer
- Made all error messages mutlilingual and deleted unnecassary ones
- Playlist shows now the file type of the file with an image (all audio files are shown as mp3, all
	video files are shown as mp4, all rom files as ROM and unknown filetypes as UFO)

To be done:
-----------
- Adding more languages
- Making several methods more efficient and robust -> partially done @robustness
- Making sure all status codes are handled properly -> partially done
- etc
