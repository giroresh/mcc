Android Media Center Client
---------------------------

General
-------

The App is a mere client to the following project: Tiny Media Center Server, which may be found here:
https://github.com/GOMF/mcs
The main focus at the moment is to implement a usable app and later on to implement the whole
scale of functionality provided by the server and finally making it visually more appealing...

The App requires at least Android 4.x (minSdkVersion="14").
It does work with SDK19 and should work also on Android L.

Current features:
-----------------

- Connecting to the server
- Setting the appropriate admin key
- Playback of audio files
- Playback of video files
- Listing all supported audio, video and rom files
- Controlling the playback of video and audio files
- Displaying available tag information
- Restarting the server
- Shutting down the server
- Multilingual (en, hu, de)
- Use Sliding Tabs for the playlist
- Switching between previous and next file is possible
  -> it works for all file types now, even though it makes not much sense atm for ROM files
- Handling rom files properly -> early stages - not trying to display tag infos anymore
  -> NES files should be "playable" if fceu is present

To be done:
-----------
- Adding more languages
- Making several methods more efficient and robust -> partially done @robustness
- Making sure all status codes are handled properly -> partially done
- etc
